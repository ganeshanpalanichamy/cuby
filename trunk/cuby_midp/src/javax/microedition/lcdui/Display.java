import javax.microedition.midlet.MIDlet;






/**
 * <code>Display</code> represents the manager of the display and
 * input devices of the
 * system. It includes methods for retrieving properties of the device and
 * for requesting that objects be displayed on the device. Other methods that
 * deal with device attributes are primarily used with {@link Canvas Canvas}
 * objects and are thus defined there instead of here. <p>
 *
 * There is exactly one instance of Display per {@link
 * javax.microedition.midlet.MIDlet MIDlet} and the application can get a
 * reference to that instance by calling the {@link
 * #getDisplay(javax.microedition.midlet.MIDlet) getDisplay()} method. The
 * application may call the <code>getDisplay()</code> method at any time
 * during course of
 * its execution. The <code>Display</code> object
 * returned by all calls to <code>getDisplay()</code> will remain the
 * same during this
 * time. <p>
 *
 * A typical application will perform the following actions in response to
 * calls to its <code>MIDlet</code> methods:
 * <UL>
 * <LI><STRONG>startApp</STRONG> - the application is moving from the
 * paused state to the active state.
 * Initialization of objects needed while the application is active should be
 * done.  The application may call
 * {@link #setCurrent(Displayable) setCurrent()} for the first screen if that
 * has not already been done. Note that <code>startApp()</code> can be
 * called several
 * times if <code>pauseApp()</code> has been called in between. This
 * means that one-time
 * initialization
 * should not take place here but instead should occur within the
 * <code>MIDlet's</code>
 * constructor.
 * </LI>
 * <LI><STRONG>pauseApp</STRONG> - the application may pause its threads.
 * Also, if it is
 * desirable to start with another screen when the application is re-activated,
 * the new screen should be set with <code>setCurrent()</code>.</LI>
 * <LI><STRONG>destroyApp</STRONG> - the application should free resources,
 * terminate threads, etc.
 * The behavior of method calls on user interface objects after
 * <code>destroyApp()</code> has returned is undefined. </li>
 * </UL>
 * <p>
 *
 * <P>The user interface objects that are shown on the display device are
 * contained within a {@link Displayable Displayable} object. At any time the
 * application may have at most one <code>Displayable</code> object
 * that it intends to be
 * shown on the display device and through which user interaction occurs.  This
 * <code>Displayable</code> is referred to as the <em>current</em>
 * <code>Displayable</code>. </p>
 *
 * <P>The <code>Display</code> class has a {@link
 * #setCurrent(Displayable) setCurrent()}
 * method for setting the current <code>Displayable</code> and a
 * {@link #getCurrent()
 * getCurrent()} method for retrieving the current
 * <code>Displayable</code>.  The
 * application has control over its current <code>Displayable</code>
 * and may call
 * <code>setCurrent()</code> at any time.  Typically, the application
 * will change the
 * current <code>Displayable</code> in response to some user action.
 * This is not always the
 * case, however.  Another thread may change the current
 * <code>Displayable</code> in
 * response to some other stimulus.  The current
 * <code>Displayable</code> will also be
 * changed when the timer for an {@link Alert Alert} elapses. </P>
 *
 * <p> The application's current <code>Displayable</code> may not
 * physically be drawn on the
 * screen, nor will user events (such as keystrokes) that occur necessarily be
 * directed to the current <code>Displayable</code>.  This may occur
 * because of the presence
 * of other <code>MIDlet</code> applications running simultaneously on
 * the same device. </p>
 *
 * <P>An application is said to be in the <em>foreground</em> if its current
 * <code>Displayable</code> is actually visible on the display device
 * and if user input
 * device events will be delivered to it. If the application is not in the
 * foreground, it lacks access to both the display and input devices, and it is
 * said to be in the <em>background</em>. The policy for allocation of these
 * devices to different <code>MIDlet</code> applications is outside
 * the scope of this
 * specification and is under the control of an external agent referred to as
 * the <em>application management software</em>. </p>
 *
 * <P>As mentioned above, the application still has a notion of its current
 * <code>Displayable</code> even if it is in the background. The
 * current <code>Displayable</code> is
 * significant, even for background applications, because the current
 * <code>Displayable</code> is always the one that will be shown the
 * next time the
 * application is brought into the foreground.  The application can determine
 * whether a <code>Displayable</code> is actually visible on the
 * display by calling {@link
 * Displayable#isShown isShown()}. In the case of <code>Canvas</code>,
 * the {@link
 * Canvas#showNotify() showNotify()} and {@link Canvas#hideNotify()
 * hideNotify()} methods are called when the <code>Canvas</code> is
 * made visible and is
 * hidden, respectively.</P>
 *
 * <P> Each <code>MIDlet</code> application has its own current
 * <code>Displayable</code>.  This means
 * that the {@link #getCurrent() getCurrent()} method returns the
 * <code>MIDlet's</code>
 * current <code>Displayable</code>, regardless of the
 * <code>MIDlet's</code> foreground/background
 * state.  For example, suppose a <code>MIDlet</code> running in the
 * foreground has current
 * <code>Displayable</code> <em>F</em>, and a <code>MIDlet</code>
 * running in the background has current
 * <code>Displayable</code> <em>B</em>.  When the foreground
 * <code>MIDlet</code> calls <code>getCurrent()</code>, it
 * will return <em>F</em>, and when the background <code>MIDlet</code>
 * calls <code>getCurrent()</code>, it
 * will return <em>B</em>.  Furthermore, if either <code>MIDlet</code>
 * changes its current
 * <code>Displayable</code> by calling <code>setCurrent()</code>, this
 * will not affect the any other
 * <code>MIDlet's</code> current <code>Displayable</code>. </p>
 *
 * <P>It is possible for <code>getCurrent()</code> to return
 * <code>null</code>. This may occur at startup
 * time, before the <code>MIDlet</code> application has called
 * <code>setCurrent()</code> on its first
 * screen.  The <code>getCurrent(</code>) method will never return a
 * reference to a
 * <code>Displayable</code> object that was not passed in a prior call
 * to <code>setCurrent()</code> call
 * by this <code>MIDlet</code>. </p>
 *
 * <a name="systemscreens"></a>
 * <h3>System Screens</h3>
 *
 * <P> Typically, the
 * current screen of the foreground <code>MIDlet</code> will be
 * visible on the display.
 * However, under certain circumstances, the system may create a screen that
 * temporarily obscures the application's current screen.  These screens are
 * referred to as <em>system screens.</em> This may occur if the system needs
 * to show a menu of commands or if the system requires the user to edit text
 * on a separate screen instead of within a text field inside a
 * <code>Form</code>.  Even
 * though the system screen obscures the application's screen, the notion of
 * the current screen does not change.  In particular, while a system screen is
 * visible, a call to <code>getCurrent()</code> will return the
 * application's current
 * screen, not the system screen.  The value returned by
 * <code>isShown()</code> is <code>false</code>
 * while the current <code>Displayable</code> is obscured by a system
 * screen. </p>
 *
 * <p> If system screen obscures a canvas, its
 * <code>hideNotify()</code> method is called.
 * When the system screen is removed, restoring the canvas, its
 * <code>showNotify()</code>
 * method and then its <code>paint()</code> method are called.  If the
 * system screen was used
 * by the user to issue a command, the <code>commandAction()</code>
 * method is called after
 * <code>showNotify()</code> is called. </p>
 *
 * <p>This class contains methods to retrieve the prevailing foreground and
 * background colors of the high-level user interface.  These methods are
 * useful for creating <CODE>CustomItem</CODE> objects that match the user
 * interface of other items and for creating user interfaces within
 * <CODE>Canvas</CODE> that match the user interface of the rest of the
 * system.  Implementations are not restricted to using foreground and
 * background colors in their user interfaces (for example, they might use
 * highlight and shadow colors for a beveling effect) but the colors returned
 * are those that match reasonably well with the implementation's color
 * scheme.  An application implementing a custom item should use the
 * background color to clear its region and then paint text and geometric
 * graphics (lines, arcs, rectangles) in the foreground color.</p>

     * had been called.  Note
     * that this will result in an exception being thrown if the current
     * <code>Displayable</code> is already an alert.  If there is no
     * current <code>Displayable</code>
     * (which may occur at startup time) the implementation's previous state
     * will be restored after the <code>Alert</code> has been

     * Causes the <code>Runnable</code> object <code>r</code> to have

     * <a href="./package-summary.html#events">Event Handling</a>
     * section of the package summary,
     * the methods that deliver event notifications to the application
     * are all called serially. The call to <code>r.run()</code> will
     * be serialized along with
     * the event calls into the application. The <code>run()</code>
     * method will be called exactly once for each call to
     * <code>callSerially()</code>. Calls to <code>run()</code> will
     * occur in the order in which they were requested by calls to
     * <code>callSerially()</code>.
     *
     * <p> If the current <code>Displayable</code> is a <code>Canvas</code>
     * that has a repaint pending at the time of a call to
     * <code>callSerially()</code>, the <code>paint()</code> method of the
     * <code>Canvas</code> will be called and
     * will return, and a buffer switch will occur (if double buffering is in
     * effect), before the <code>run()</code> method of the
     * <code>Runnable</code> is called.
     * If the current <code>Displayable</code> contains one or more
     * <code>CustomItems</code> that have repaints pending at the time
     * of a call to <code>callSerially()</code>, the <code>paint()</code>
     * methods of the <code>CustomItems</code> will be called and will
     * return before the <code>run()</code> method of the
     * <code>Runnable</code> is called.
     * Calls to the
     * <code>run()</code> method will occur in a timely fashion, but
     * they are not guaranteed
     * to occur immediately after the repaint cycle finishes, or even before
     * the next event is delivered. </p>
     *
     * <p> The <code>callSerially()</code> method may be called from
     * any thread. The call to
     * the <code>run()</code> method will occur independently of the
     * call to <code>callSerially()</code>.
     * In particular, <code>callSerially()</code> will <em>never</em>
     * block waiting
     * for <code>r.run()</code>
     * to return. </p>
     *
     * <p> As with other callbacks, the call to <code>r.run()</code>
     * must return quickly. If
     * it is necessary to perform a long-running operation, it may be initiated
     * from within the <code>run()</code> method. The operation itself
     * should be performed
     * within another thread, allowing <code>run()</code> to return. </p>
     *
     * <p> The <code>callSerially()</code> facility may be used by
     * applications to run an
     * animation that is properly synchronized with the repaint cycle. A
     * typical application will set up a frame to be displayed and then call
     * <code>repaint()</code>.  The application must then wait until
     * the frame is actually
     * displayed, after which the setup for the next frame may occur.  The call
     * to <code>run()</code> notifies the application that the
     * previous frame has finished
     * painting.  The example below shows <code>callSerially()</code>
     * being used for this
     * purpose. </p>
