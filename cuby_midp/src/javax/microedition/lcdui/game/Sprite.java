/**
 * A Sprite is a basic visual element that can be rendered with one of
 * several frames stored in an Image; different frames can be shown to 
 * animate the Sprite.  Several transforms such as flipping and rotation
 * can also be applied to a Sprite to further vary its appearance.  As with
 * all Layer subclasses, a Sprite's location can be changed and it can also
 * be made visible or invisible.
 * <P>
 * <h3>Sprite Frames</h3>
 * The raw frames used to render a Sprite are provided in a single Image
 * object, which may be mutable or immutable.  If more than one frame is used,
 * the Image is broken up into a series of equally-sized frames of a specified
 * width and height.  As shown in the figure below, the same set of frames may
 * be stored in several different arrangements depending on what is the most 
 * convenient for the game developer.  
 * <br>
 * <center><img src="doc-files/frames.gif" width=777 height=402 
 * ALT="Sprite Frames"></center>
 * <br>
 * <p>
 * Each frame is assigned a unique index number.  The frame located in the
 * upper-left corner of the Image is assigned an index of 0.  The remaining 
 * frames are then numbered consecutively in row-major order (indices are 
 * assigned across the first row, then the second row, and so on).  The method
 * {@link #getRawFrameCount()} returns the total number of raw frames.
 * <P>
 * <h3>Frame Sequence</h3>
 * A Sprite's frame sequence defines an ordered list of frames to be displayed.
 * The default frame sequence mirrors the list of available frames, so 
 * there is a direct mapping between the sequence index and the corresponding
 * frame index.  This also means that the length of the default frame sequence
 * is equal to the number of raw frames.  For example, if a Sprite has 4 
 * frames, its default frame sequence is {0, 1, 2, 3}.  
 * <center><img src="doc-files/defaultSequence.gif" width=182 height=269 
 * ALT="Default Frame Sequence"></center>
 * <P>
 * The developer must manually switch the current frame in the frame sequence.
 * This may be accomplished by calling {@link #setFrame}, 
 * {@link #prevFrame()}, or {@link #nextFrame()}.  Note that these methods 
 * always operate on the sequence index, they do not operate on frame indices;
 * however, if the default frame sequence is used, then the sequence indices
 * and the frame indices are interchangeable.
 * <P>
 * If desired, an arbitrary frame sequence may be defined for a Sprite.  
 * The frame sequence must contain at least one element, and each element must
 * reference a valid frame index.  By defining a new frame sequence, the 
 * developer can conveniently display the Sprite's frames in any order 
 * desired; frames may be repeated, omitted, shown in reverse order, etc.
 * <P>
 * For example, the diagram below shows how a special frame sequence might be
 * used to animate a mosquito.  The frame sequence is designed so that the 
 * mosquito flaps its wings three times and then pauses for a moment before 
 * the cycle is repeated.
 * <center><img src="doc-files/specialSequence.gif" width=346 height=510 
 * ALT="Special Frame Sequence"></center>
 * By calling {@link #nextFrame} each time the display is updated, the 
 * resulting animation would like this:
 * <br>
 * <center><img src="doc-files/sequenceDemo.gif" width=96 height=36></center>
 * <P>
 * <h3>Reference Pixel</h3>
 * Being a subclass of Layer, Sprite inherits various methods for setting and
 * retrieving its location such as {@link #setPosition setPosition(x,y)}, 
 * {@link #getX getX()}, and {@link #getY getY()}.  These methods all define
 * position in terms of the upper-left corner of the Sprite's visual bounds;
 * however, in some cases, it is more convenient to define the Sprite's position
 * in terms of an arbitrary pixel within its frame, especially if transforms
 * are applied to the Sprite.
 * <P>
 * Therefore, Sprite includes the concept of a <em>reference pixel</em>.    
 * The reference pixel is defined by specifying its location in the
 * Sprite's untransformed frame using 
 * {@link #defineReferencePixel defineReferencePixel(x,y)}.  
 * By default, the reference pixel is defined to be the pixel at (0,0) 
 * in the frame.  If desired, the reference pixel may be defined outside 
 * of the frame's bounds.    
 * <p>
 * In this example, the reference pixel is defined to be the pixel that
 * the monkey appears to be hanging from:
 * <p>
 * <center><img src="doc-files/refpixel.gif" width=304 height=199
 * ALT="Defining The Reference Pixel"></center>
 * <p>
 * {@link #getRefPixelX getRefPixelX()} and {@link #getRefPixelY getRefPixelY()}
 * can be used to query the location of the reference pixel in the painter's 
 * coordinate system.  The developer can also use 
 * {@link #setRefPixelPosition setRefPixelPosition(x,y)} to position the Sprite 
 * so that reference pixel appears at a specific location in the painter's
 * coordinate system.  These methods automatically account for any transforms
 * applied to the Sprite.
 * <p>
 * In this example, the reference pixel's position is set to a point at the end 
 * of a tree branch; the Sprite's location changes so that the reference pixel
 * appears at this point and the monkey appears to be hanging from the branch:
 * <p>
 * <center><img src="doc-files/setrefposition.gif" width=332 height=350
 * ALT="Setting The Reference Pixel Position"></center>
 * <p>
 * <a name="transforms"></a>
 * <h3>Sprite Transforms</h3>
 * Various transforms can be applied to a Sprite.  The available transforms
 * include rotations in multiples of 90 degrees, and mirrored (about
 * the vertical axis) versions of each of the rotations.  A Sprite's transform 
 * is set by calling {@link #setTransform setTransform(transform)}.
 * <p>
 * <center><img src="doc-files/transforms.gif" width=355 height=575 
 * ALT="Transforms"></center>
 * <br>
 * When a transform is applied, the Sprite is automatically repositioned 
 * such that the  reference pixel appears stationary in the painter's 
 * coordinate system.  Thus, the reference pixel effectively becomes the
 * center of the transform operation.  Since the reference pixel does not
 * move, the values returned by {@link #getRefPixelX()} and 
 * {@link #getRefPixelY()} remain the same; however, the values returned by
 * {@link #getX getX()} and {@link #getY getY()} may change to reflect the 
 * movement of the Sprite's upper-left corner.
 * <p>
 * Referring to the monkey example once again, the position of the 
 * reference pixel remains at (48, 22) when a 90 degree rotation
 * is applied, thereby making it appear as if the monkey is swinging
 * from the branch:
 * <p>
 * <center><img src="doc-files/transcenter.gif" width=333 height=350
 * ALT="Transform Center"></center>
 * <p>
 * <h3>Sprite Drawing</h3>
 * Sprites can be drawn at any time using the {@link #paint(Graphics)} method.  
 * The Sprite will be drawn on the Graphics object according to the current 
 * state information maintained by the Sprite (i.e. position, frame, 
 * visibility).  Erasing the Sprite is always the responsibility of code 
 * outside the Sprite class.<p>
 * <p>
 * Sprites can be implemented using whatever techniques a manufacturers 
 * wishes to use (e.g hardware acceleration may be used for all Sprites, for
 * certain sizes of Sprites, or not at all).
 * <p>
 * For some platforms, certain Sprite sizes may be more efficient than others;
 * manufacturers may choose to provide developers with information about
 * device-specific characteristics such as these.

     * {@link #TRANS_NONE}.
     * <P>

     * use may result in the overall width and height of the Sprite 
     * being swapped.  As a result, the values returned by 
     * {@link Layer#getWidth} and {@link Layer#getHeight} may change.
     * <p>
     * The collision rectangle is also modified by the transform so that
     * it remains static relative to the pixel data of the Sprite.  
     * Similarly, the defined reference pixel is unchanged by this method,
     * but its visual location within the Sprite may change as a result.
     * <P>
     * This method repositions the Sprite so that the location of 
     * the reference pixel in the painter's coordinate system does not change
     * as a result of changing the transform.  Thus, the reference pixel 
     * effectively becomes the centerpoint for the transform.  Consequently,
     * the values returned by {@link #getRefPixelX} and {@link #getRefPixelY} 
     * will be the same both before and after the transform is applied, but
